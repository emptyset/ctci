# Cracking the Coding Interview: Exercises
I have created this project for the purpose of developing the skills I need to
perform well at coding tests for software engineering interviews.

Others may find my exercise solutions helpful, too.

## Usage
To execute the tests to validate the exercise solutions:

    docker-compose run --rm exercises
