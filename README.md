# Cracking the Coding Interview: Exercises
This project was created for the purpose of developing the skills I need to
perform well at coding assessments for software engineering interviews.

It is my hope this project could be a good reference for others.

## Objectives
Having settled on **python** as my code interview language, my objectives
include:

- Language Immersion
Minimize time spent looking up language features or constructs.

- Problem Space Familiarity
Recognize similar problems and apply solutions I have done before.

- Improve Coding Speed
Complete coding assessments as quickly as possible.

## Methodology
These solutions are my own, submitted on the honor system.  Unless expressly
noted, I neither reference the solutions in the CTCI nor solutions from
others on the internet.  Where possible, I will only look up information in
the official **python** documentation.

Each problem is solved within a single coding session.  I may go back and
submit a better solution if I think of one after the fact; that is reflected
in the commit log.

I'm working the problems in order, so if I get stumped, I will skip it and
this will also be reflected by the commit log.

## Usage
To execute the tests to validate the exercise solutions:

    docker-compose run --rm exercises
